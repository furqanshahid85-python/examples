# Unified Data Integration to Enable AI (RAG)

This project showcases how you can unify and integrate different real-time and batch data sources and use them to create a RAG system using a real life usecase.

## Prerequisites
set up the following tools on your device:
1. Clone the GitHub repo that contains all the source code for this tutorial:
``` git clone https://github.com/estuary/examples.git ```
2. Sign up for Estuary account for free.
3. Install Docker on your desktop. You can follow this tutorial. This project contains a Docker-based environment to help you easily set up data sources and load data into them. 
4. Sign up for a ngrok account. Ngrok is a lightweight tool that exposes your Postgres database container running on the local host to the internet.
5. Download MongoDB compass and create a free MongoDB Atlas account. 
6. Set up a Pinecone account. Pinecone has a free version that you can use. This will be our destination vector database.
7. Set up an OpenAI account. We will use OpenAIâ€™s LLM model to evaluate the RAG embeddings we create and get answers to user prompts.
